# ScrappInvest
<h4>Project developed by [Arthur Romanha]([https://github.com/ArthurRomanha])</h4>
This investment tracking spreadsheet was developed to monitor stock market assets, allowing me to learn and apply my knowledge about APIs. I created my own API that performs web scraping on a website and returns the data used by my front-end application.
